# Deldora RPG

This is a little testgame i'm making using flutter without any game engines like [Flame](https://pub.dev/packages/flame) or [Forge2D](https://pub.dev/packages/forge2d).

Esse Ã© um pegueno jogo de teste que estou criando via FLutter, sem usar qualquer engine de jogos como [Flame](https://pub.dev/packages/flame) ou [Forge2D](https://pub.dev/packages/forge2d).

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application, so it needs to be builded or debuged with a Flutter environment.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first time reading about [Flutter, the Library from Google](https://flutter.dev).

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
